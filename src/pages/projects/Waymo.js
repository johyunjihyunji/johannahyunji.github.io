              <p className="paragraph">
              It was challenging to reshape perceptions around this cutting-edge technology often deemed "not safe." 
              The primary hurdle was to make autonomous driving technology more 
              approachable and acceptable to the emerging generation of users. Successfully rebranding Waymo required more than just a visual transformation;
               it demanded the establishment of a new norm.
              The goal was to shape a narrative that would encourage users to perceive self-driving car services positively. 
              This involved not only addressing concerns about safety but also fostering a sense of trust and familiarity.
